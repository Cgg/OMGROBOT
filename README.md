What's that
===========

The goal of this project was to experiment with feedback loop based on polar
coordinates.

A basic robot simulation is drawn in a canvas. The robot can be controlled directly
with the keyboard arrows, or be given a list of point to go through. In this
later mode, the robot uses a feedback loop based on its polar coordinates and
two PID controllers.


How to
======

Use your keyboard arrows to make the robot move around, or click around to
define the checkpoints of the trajectory (right click will terminate the
trajectory and the robot will start moving).
